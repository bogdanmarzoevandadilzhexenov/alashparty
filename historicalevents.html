          Members of the Alash party were the largest in the government of Alash Orda. As you know, history is created by the people, laws and legal documents regulating the laws of historical development of society, political and legal doctrines are implemented by specific individuals, and the state language also has a great role in this area. We know from history that during the years when the Kazakh land was under the rule of the Russian self-government for more than two centuries, the Kazakh people were deprived of the right to rule their own destiny, a people with a unique political history dating back to the Blue Turkic era, completely blocked by Imperial laws.

                    The <strong>Alash movement</strong> is a national liberation movement directed in the first quarter of the XX century against the colonial system of power of the Russian Empire. At the beginning of the XX century, the strengthening of the Russian system of government in the Kazakh steppe, a sharp increase in the number of immigrants from Russia, and the displacement of Kazakhs from fertile lands began. Now there is a question of strengthening the struggle for self-preservation of the Kazakh people. But now it was necessary to fight not by means of a multi-armed uprising, but by a rational political way. Thus, the actions of the Kazakh intelligentsia, who began to fight for the interests of the Kazakh people on the roads of the first Russian Revolution, became the beginning of the subsequent <strong>Alash movement.</strong> Under the leadership of <a class="textlink" href="members\alikhan.html"><em>A. Bukeikhanov</em></a>, <a class="textlink" href="members\akhmet.html"><em>A. Baitursynov</em></a>, <a class="textlink" href="members\mirjaqip.html"><em>M. Dulatuli</em></a>, the National intelligentsia began to master the ways of political struggle for <strong>National Liberation.</strong> They took part in various movements, established the publication of newspapers and books for propaganda work. Since 1911, the magazine <em>"Aykap",</em> since 1913 <em>"Kazakh",</em> then the newspapers <em>"Birlik Tuy"," Saryarka","Akzhol"</em> served to determine the path of national liberation struggle.

                    The main goal of the <strong>Alash movement</strong> was the struggle for self - government of the Kazakh people and the gradual creation of an independent state, the restriction of resettlement on the Kazakh lands, respect for Human Rights, the development of the economy, and the prestige of the Kazakh language. Thanks to the Alash movement, in 1917 the Kazakh committees, the Turkestan autonomy and the government of <strong>Alashorda</strong> were formed. In 1917, these political structures were forcibly dissolved by the Bolsheviks. All supporters of the Alash movement were persecuted and executed. But the forces of the <strong>National Liberation Movement,</strong> which began with the <strong>Alash movement,</strong> did not immediately leave the scene of political struggle. Then the <strong>National Liberation</strong> continued in a new character in the activities of such intellectuals as <em>T. Ryskulov, S. Sadvakasov, S. Spandiyarov, S. Kozhanov, Zh.Mynbayev.</em> However, the totalitarian authorities punished them en masse as followers of the <strong>Alash movement.</strong> Thus, the <strong>Alash National Liberation Movement,</strong> which began with the first Russian Revolution, continued until the 30s.

                    The newspaper <em>"Kazakh"</em> is a socio-political, literary and cultural publication published in Orenburg in 1913-1918. Number 1 was issued on February 2, 1913. Until 1915, it was published once a week, and then twice. The leader of those who helped the newspaper financially is Mustafa Orazayuly. In total, the number 265 was published. The newspaper presented the yurt as a symbol-video. His nightgown was open from the West, and on the door was written <em>"Kazakh".</em> Explaining this, the National intelligentsia wrote: <q><tt>Let the science and art of Europe spread in Kazakhstan, let the newspaper "Kazakh" be the door of culture to the Kazakh people, as well as a guard from the outside.</tt></q>

                    The <strong>February Revolution</strong> is a revolution that overthrew the <em>Tsarist government</em> in the Russian Empire on February 27 (March 12), 1917, and established a bourgeois-democratic republic in the country. The victory of the <strong>February Revolution</strong>, in addition to creating conditions for the transition to the upper stage of the political system — Republican construction, also made it possible to weaken the power of the colonial system. The <a class="textlink" href="#fourthpanel"><em>Provisional Government</em></a>, established by the decision of the <strong>State Duma</strong>, which seized official power as a result of the <strong>February Revolution</strong>, recognized the right of the Kazakh people to self-rule in 1916. The attempts of the punitive expeditions to punish those who participated in the <strong>National Liberation</strong> uprising of 1916 were stopped. The most important result of the victory of the <strong>February Revolution</strong> was the democratization of all public life, in which large-scale political freedoms took place on the territory of the former Russian Empire. Throughout the region, freedoms of bourgeois significance <em>(the creation of a political organization, the word, the press, etc.)</em> began to be implemented, parties of a secret type became public, and the creation of new parties and other political organizations was allowed.

                    However, the victory of the <strong>February Revolution</strong> did not solve all the problems of public life. Although the <strong>February Revolution</strong> overthrew the monarchy, it did not completely destroy the old administrative apparatus on earth. The struggle for the creation of new government bodies became complex and prolonged. Along with the organs of the bourgeois provisional government, the <strong>Soviets</strong> of workers, soldiers and peasants councils were formed in the center, headed by the <em>Petrograd Council.</em> In the first days after the victory of the revolution, there was considerable power in the hands of the Soviets. The country had a system of dual government <em>(the official provisional government and its local system and the Soviets, which had real power).</em>

                    The <strong>Provisional Government</strong> is a body of power created in Russia as a result of the <a class="textlink" href="#thirdpanel"><em>February Revolution</em></a>. The provisional committee, consisting of members of the fourth <strong>State Duma</strong> and the Petrograd Council of workers and soldiers Deputies, was formed on March 2, 1917 and headed by Prince <em>G. Lvov</em>. The <strong>Provisional Government</strong> was to hold power until the <strong>All-Russian Constituent Assembly</strong> was convened and the format of public administration was decided. The Provisional Government announced that there are no restrictions on the rights of Russian citizens, depending on their religion and nationality. Nevertheless, the <strong>Provisional Government</strong> advocated the continuation of Russia's participation in the first World War. This, in turn, led to further aggravation of social relations. On March 5, The <strong>Provisional Government</strong> issued a resolution on the establishment of local authorities. In Kazakhstan, as in other regions of Russia, local bodies of the <strong>Provisional Government</strong> appeared at the initial stage on the basis of civil committees. The initiative in the creation of these committees was in the hands of the Russian public living in the regional and district centers, and the leading positions in the committees also belonged to them.

At the Russian level, the <strong>All-Russian Congress of Muslims</strong> was held, at which the All-Russian Council of Muslims was formed, which represented the interests of the <strong>Muslim</strong> peoples in the context of a provisional government. On June 17, the <strong>Provisional Government</strong> issued a decree on the introduction of zemstvo in the steppe regions. In this regard, in <em>Uralsk, Akmola, Semipalatinsk, Turgay regions,</em> the establishment of zemstvo institutions and the introduction of Kazakh representatives began. On July 7, <em>A. F. Kerensky</em> was appointed chairman of the <strong>Provisional Government</strong>. At the end of August, there was a rebellion led by <em>L. G. Kornilov</em> in order to seize power from the <strong>Provisional Government</strong>. But Kerensky, the head of the <strong>Provisional Government</strong>, managed to suppress the rebellion, relying on the help of the Council of workers and soldiers Deputies. However, the Provisional Government has shown itself to be powerless to deal with the social burdens caused by the protracted war, especially food shortages. This, in turn, contributed to the growth of the authority of opposition forces among the population of the <strong>Provisional Government</strong>. On October 25, 1917, the <strong>Provisional Government</strong> collapsed as a result of the <a class="textlink" href="#sixthpanel"><em>October Revolution</em></a>. The <strong>Bolshevik Party</strong> led by <em>V. I. Lenin</em> came to power, and soon a civil war broke out in the country.

Dosmukhamedov considered it necessary to immediately declare autonomy. In the end, the two sides reached a common agreement. As a result, Turkestan was annexed to the Kazakh people, and a period of 1 month was given for the declaration of autonomy. It was decided that autonomy would be declared, even if there was no accession for a month. For this purpose, <a class="textlink" href="members\mirjaqip.html"><em>M. Dulatuli</em></a>, B. Kulmanov, T. Kunanbayuly were specially sent to the Syrdarya Congress, convened on January 5, 1918 "to raise the issue of unification". However, during the specified month, the connection status remained unchanged. The autonomy of Turkestan also forcibly stopped its work. Kazakh figures did not regroup to declare autonomy. The resolution of <a class="textlink" href="#seventhpanel"><em>the second all-Kazakh Congress</em></a> remained in force and will now be written in official papers as <strong>"Alash autonomy".</strong> Even such a stamp is preserved in documents in the archives.
