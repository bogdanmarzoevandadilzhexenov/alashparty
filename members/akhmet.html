				<strong>Akhmet Baitursynov</strong> (1973-1937) <em>(Kazakh: Ахмет Байтұрсынұлы)</em> was a Kazakh intellectual who worked in the fields of politics, poetry, linguistics and education. Baitursynov reformed the <strong>Kazakh alphabet.</strong> In 1912, he excluded all the purely Arabic letters not used in the Kazakh language and added letters specific to the Kazakh language. The new alphabet, named Tote <em>jazu,</em> is still used by Kazakhs living in China, Afghanistan, and in Iran. Baitursynov also developed the basics of Kazakh and the scientific terminology for the definition of Kazakh grammar. In 1937, he was executed by a firing squad during the Great Purge.<br><br>
