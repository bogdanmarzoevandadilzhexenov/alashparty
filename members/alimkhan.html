				He was born in 1891 in <em>Boriktas, Aktogay district, Karaganda region.</em> His father, Abeu, was respected by the people, was a progressive thinker, literate in Russian, and was one of the intellectuals of his era. In 1899, he entered the Karkaraly City School. Alimkhan, who was attentive and capable at the school, graduated with honors and entered the Semipalatinsk men's Gymnasium in 1905. He graduated from this educational institution with a gold medal in 1912 and was accepted to the mining Faculty of the Tomsk Institute of technology.

				During his studies in Tomsk, he got acquainted with leading Russian thinkers and scientists. Shokan Ualikhanov's friend Grigory Nikolaevich Potanin sees and admires Alimkhan's desire for knowledge.   Alimkhan Yermekov showed that he knows English, German, French, and Italian in the questionnaires he filled out with his own hands. Almost all those who were colleagues, students and met with Alimkhan Yermekov expressed warm words about Alimkhan.

    		After the overthrow of Tsarist power, Kazakh congresses were opened everywhere to determine the current situation in the country and decide what to do next. For the first time, A. Yermekov took part in the political work of the Alash movement, in the Semipalatinsk regional Kazakh Congress, which was held from April 27 to May 7, 1917. There, together with other people, he was elected to the secretariat of the Presidium of the Congress, and then, by the decision of the Congress, to become a member of the Semipalatinsk regional Kazakh committee.

   		<p class="thirdtext">
   			At the All-Kazakhstan Congress in July, Semipalatinsk region was nominated for a deputy to the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. On October 8-17, 1917, he represented the 1st Siberian Regional Congress, a meeting of Delegates, and was included in its presidium from the Semipalatinsk region. At the Congress, a committee was formed to write the Basic Law of Siberian autonomy, which included Kazakh delegates A. Ermekov.

   		<p class="fourthtext">
   			One of the great historical merits of Alikhan Yermekov is the selfless defense of the unity of the Kazakh autonomy. In this regard, on August 17, 1920, when the issue of Kazakh autonomy was considered at the meeting of the Council of people's commissars, which was attended by Kazakh representatives chaired by Lenin, A. Yermekov made a report on the state of Kazakhstan. It covers the issues of the land, the borders of Kazakhstan, actively fights with representatives of authoritarian, aggressive, colonial motives, and defends his opinion with clear, comprehensive, irrefutable arguments. The occupiers admitted their guilt, and as a result, the vast land on the teriskey coast of the Caspian Sea, which was once seized from the Kazakhs, one kilometer wide and ten kilometers on the Left Bank of the Irtysh, with the direct support of Lenin, will be returned to Kazakhstan.
