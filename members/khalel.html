    		In 1917, he was elected to the Council of the nation — the government of <strong>Alash Orda,</strong> proclaimed at the II all-Kazakh Congress. Together with the <strong>Alash</strong> figures, he first made efforts to form the National Army — the people's militia, which protects the people from Rebellion, the creation of the <strong>Alash</strong> fund, and the collection of tribute funds from the country. When the rule of the Bolsheviks, who forcibly seized power from the Provisional Government, was strengthened, they held face-to-face negotiations with the head of the <strong>Soviet government,</strong> V. I. Lenin, and the people's commissar for national affairs, <em>I. V. Stalin.</em> When the Bolsheviks fully recognized the Soviet power and demanded unconditional submission, they put forward such important issues as the partial transfer of power to the <strong>Alashorda,</strong> the return to the Kazakhs of all places of concentration of Kazakhs, the release from prison of Alash figures arrested by the <strong>Soviet</strong> authorities everywhere, the cessation of their persecution, financial assistance.

   			In 1918, at the 4th congress of Kazakhs of the Ural region, held in Zhympity, he took part in the proclamation of the <em>"Provisional Government of the <abbr title="UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning"><blink>UIL</blink></abbr> ualayaty"</em>-a national territorial structure that would influence the entire western region of Kazakhstan. In mid-September of the same year, alashorda leaders, who met at the meeting to declare the Directorate of anti-Soviet forces, supported this structure and gave it the name <em>"Western Branch of Alashorda".</em> During this period, Khalel contributed a lot to organizing the cavalry of Alashorda, obtaining weapons from the Komuch government in Samara, opening a National Bank, publishing a printing house, and publishing a newspaper <em>"Erkin Kazak".</em> After the dissolution of the Alashorda, Khalel, like other Kazakh intellectuals, will be involved in the work of the new government.
