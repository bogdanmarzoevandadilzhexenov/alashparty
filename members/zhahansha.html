				Zhakhansha was born in 1887 in the family of a steppe cattle breeder Dosmukhamed from the Kazakh family of <em>Karakunan Tana.</em> Russian Russian-Kazakh father arranged for Zhakhansha to attend the Buldurta aul mobile Russian-Kazakh school, after which Zhakhansha entered the Russian-Kazakh school in the village of <em>Dzhambeyty.</em> Considering Zhakhanshi's abilities, the school's management recommended sending him to the Ural Military Real School. The volost administrator, an honorary citizen of the Russian Empire Mukhamedzhan Sarykudzhin, helped Dosmukhamedov to get into this educational institution.

				Zhakhansha was first enrolled in the preparatory class of the military real school in Uralsk, then entered the first year. There were 300 students in one preparatory, six main and one additional classes of the school, including 18 Kazakh children, whose scholarships were paid by Kazakh elders - stewards of steppe volosts. Among these 18 students are Zhakhansha and his future ally in the <strong>Alash party,</strong> <a class="textlink" href="..\members\khalel.html"><em>Khalel Dosmukhamedov.</em></a> Thanks to his excellent memory, Zhakhansha showed knowledge in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. During his college years, he went from class to class without exams.
